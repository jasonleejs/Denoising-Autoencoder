# Implementing the Denoising Autoencoder
Implementation of a simple denoising autoencoder for the purpose of practicing a use case in Masked Image Modelling. 

The `Denoise EMNIST.ipynb` notebook will demonstrate training a DAE on 28x28 handwriting images with randomly missing pixels and try to reconstruct an original image.
