# Implementing the Denoising Autoencoder
The objective of this repository is to implement a simple denoising autoencoder and to demonstrate a use case in Masked Image Modelling. 

The `Denoise EMNIST.ipynb` notebook will demonstrate training a DAE on 28x28 handwriting images with randomly missing pixels and try to reconstruct an original image.
